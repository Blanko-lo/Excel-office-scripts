This tool will get the new days date and will fill a custom number of cells from the current selected cell.
This is helpful when paired with a frozen top row and adding the script to the workbook as a button placed into the top row. 

inorder to set this up the easiest way use the following steps: 

1. navigate to the automate ribbon and locate new script

2. click new script (usually there will already be something in the code editor just press ctrl + a and press backspace to delete the default script generated.) 

3. copy all the code from the auto_date.ts file and paste it into the code editor in located in your excel workbook.

4. change the words in quotes "insert number here" to the number of cells you want to fill. (Vertically)

5. name the script to whatever you want then click save
